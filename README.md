# org-show-ledes

Show all headings, as well as the first paragraph of each section in an org-mode file. **WIP!**

This can be useful to get an overview of long prose documents. It works especially well if you start each section with signposting introductions: "In this section, I will..." But other writing styles benefit as well â€” it's easier to remember the gist of a section from a whole paragraph than from the heading only.
