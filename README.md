# org-show-ledes (WIP)

Show all headings, as well as the first paragraph in each body.

This can be useful to get an overview of long prose documents. It works especially well if you start each section with signposting introductions: "In this section, I will..." But other writing styles benefit as well â€” it's easier to remember the gist of a section from a whole paragraph than from the heading only.
